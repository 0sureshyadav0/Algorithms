# Sorting Algorithms
## Bubble sort
- The basic idea of bubble sorting is that is repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are not in the desired order.
## Selection sort 
- Selection sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.
## Insertion sort
- Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
## Quick sort
- Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the devide and conquer approach. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
## Merge sort
- Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.
## Radix sort
- The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit.
